# DISARM API Google Sheets integration: proof-of-concept

The attached code copies data from a Google Sheets table, reformats and sends to DiSARM API. The response is then reshaped and inserted back into the table.

To run, copy into the 'Script editor' of a Google Sheet (but will need specific shaped data already in the sheet).
